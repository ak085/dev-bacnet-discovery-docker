## [0.6.2] - 2025-11-09

### Added

#### Infrastructure
- Internal MQTT broker (Eclipse Mosquitto 2) integrated into docker-compose
  - Runs on port 1884 (host) / 1883 (internal)
  - Always-on service with health checks
  - Persistent data and log volumes
  - Configuration via `mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf`

#### Database Management
- TimescaleDB cleanup script (`timescaledb/cleanup_database.sh`)
  - Show database statistics (--stats)
  - Truncate all data (--truncate)
  - Keep only recent hours (--keep-hours N)
  - Delete data older than N days (--older-than-days N)
  - Safety confirmations for destructive operations
  - Before/after statistics display
- Documentation: `doc/TIMESCALEDB_CLEANUP.md` (comprehensive guide)
- Documentation: `TIMESCALEDB_MAINTENANCE.md` (quick reference)

#### Dashboard UI
- Manual "Refresh Now" button with visual feedback
  - Separate refresh state from initial page load
  - Animated spinning icon during refresh
  - Button disabled during refresh operation
  - Dynamic text ("Refreshing..." vs "Refresh Now")
- Auto-refresh checkbox still functional (10-second interval)

### Changed

#### MQTT Architecture
- Switched from external MQTT broker (10.0.60.2) to internal broker
  - Worker uses `localhost:1884` (host networking)
  - Frontend uses `mqtt-broker:1883` (Docker bridge network)
  - Telegraf uses `mqtt-broker:1883` (Docker bridge network)
  - Smart broker resolution for frontend components

#### Worker Configuration
- Unique MQTT client IDs to prevent conflicts
  - Worker: `bacpipes_worker`
  - Telegraf: `bacpipes_telegraf`
  - Client IDs not loaded from database (hardcoded)
- Removed `raise` statement in telegraf error handler (prevents crashes)
- Fixed paho-mqtt 2.1.0 callback signatures (added `disconnect_flags` parameter)

#### Frontend
- Monitoring page connects to internal broker via smart resolution
  - Maps `localhost` → `mqtt-broker` for Docker containers
  - Maps port `1884` → `1883` (host → container)
  - External brokers passed through unchanged
- Write command API uses same smart broker resolution

### Fixed

- **Dashboard refresh button**: Now fully functional with proper state management
- **MQTT reconnection loop**: Eliminated by fixing client ID conflicts
- **Telegraf crashes**: Fixed callback signature mismatch for paho-mqtt 2.1.0
- **Frontend MQTT connection**: Resolved ECONNREFUSED errors via broker resolution
- **Write command failures**: Fixed connection issues to MQTT broker
- **Data collection rate**: Reduced from 66 readings/2min to 8 readings/2min (correct rate)
- **Database insert errors**: No longer crash MQTT loop in telegraf

### Technical Details

#### MQTT Client ID Management
- Worker and telegraf previously shared `bacpipes_worker` client ID
- Caused mutual disconnections every 1-2 seconds
- Now use separate hardcoded client IDs
- Database clientId field preserved for future flexibility

#### Docker Networking
- Frontend runs in bridge network (cannot access `localhost` on host)
- Smart resolution function maps localhost:1884 → mqtt-broker:1883
- Worker uses host networking (accesses broker at localhost:1884)
- Telegraf uses bridge networking (accesses broker at mqtt-broker:1883)

#### Data Cleanup
- Successfully tested truncate operation (cleared 3,375 duplicate readings)
- Cleanup script supports partial deletion by time range
- Confirmed correct polling intervals (5 seconds per point)

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive pre-release checklist (`PRE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`)
- Documented internal MQTT broker setup and configuration
- Documented TimescaleDB cleanup procedures
- Updated README.md with MQTT broker details (pending)

### Migration Notes

- **Breaking Change**: MQTT broker now internal by default
  - External broker still supported via Settings GUI
  - Update Settings page if using custom broker
  - Restart services after changing broker configuration

- **Database**: No schema changes, no migration required

- **Configuration**: Update .env if needed:
  ```bash
  MQTT_BROKER=localhost  # For worker (host networking)
  MQTT_PORT=1884         # Host-mapped port
  ```

### Known Issues

- Internal broker data not backed up automatically (add to backup procedures)
- Worker must be restarted manually after timezone/broker changes
- MONITORING_PAGE_PLAN.md contains outdated information (archive pending)

---

## [0.6.1] - 2025-11-08

### Added

#### Dashboard
- New Dashboard page (`/`) with system overview
- Real-time statistics (devices, points, publishing status)
- System status indicator (operational/degraded/error)
- Configuration summary cards (BACnet, MQTT, System)
- Discovered devices list with point counts
- Recent point values table (top 10 most recent)
- Quick navigation links to all pages
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- Dashboard summary API endpoint (`/api/dashboard/summary`)

#### UI Improvements
- Icons added to all pages (Dashboard, Discovery, Points, Monitoring)
- Consistent color scheme across application:
  - Blue: Network/Infrastructure/Discovery
  - Green: Success/MQTT/Active
  - Red: Error/Inactive
  - Purple: Monitoring/Live data
  - Amber: Devices/Hardware
  - Cyan: Data/Points
- Left border color accents on cards for visual hierarchy
- Professional lucide-react icons throughout
- Navigation component with active route highlighting
- Page headers with descriptive icons

### Fixed
- **MQTT Configuration Loading**: Worker now reads MQTT broker address from database (Settings GUI) instead of `.env` file
  - Settings GUI is now the source of truth for MQTT configuration
  - `.env` file serves as fallback default only
  - Changes in Settings page take effect after worker restart
- Batch publishing configuration correctly loaded from database

### Changed
- Disabled batch publishing by default (can be re-enabled in Settings)
- MQTT configuration loading order: Database → Environment variables
- Worker logs now show "MQTT Broker from database" when loading from Settings GUI

### Documentation
- Clarified batch publishing use cases (ML/AI vs monitoring)
- Documented MQTT configuration hierarchy
- Added explanation of synchronized timestamps in individual topics

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-07

### Added

#### Phase 5: Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time MQTT data streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Live monitoring page at `/monitoring`
- In-place value updates (stable rows, no scrolling)
- Natural webpage scrolling with sticky table headers
- Topic filtering and search
- Pause/resume data stream
- Connection status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Unique points counter

#### Phase 6: BACnet Write Commands
- Write command UI in monitoring page
- Write button for all points (with warning for non-writable points)
- Priority level selector (1-16, default: 8)
- Priority release functionality
- Write result feedback (success/error messages)
- Direct presentValue writes (no priority array complexity)
- Support for all object types (AI, AO, AV, BI, BO, BV, MSV, etc.)
- MQTT-based write command architecture
- Write job ID tracking
- Queue-based command processing in worker

#### Timezone Support
- Configurable timezone in Settings page
- 500+ IANA timezones supported
- Worker loads timezone from database on startup
- MQTT timestamps use configured timezone
- Monitoring page displays timestamps from worker (no local override)

### Changed
- Monitoring page timestamp handling (uses worker's timestamp instead of frontend server time)
- SSE endpoint now preserves original MQTT timestamps
- Updated milestone tracking (M1-M6 complete)
- Improved documentation in README.md

### Fixed
- MQTT write command threading issue (callback → queue → async loop)
- BACnet write "property-is-not-an-array" errors (removed priority array logic)
- Monitoring page scrolling UX (removed fixed-height container)
- Timezone changes now reflected in MQTT timestamps
- Worker restart now properly loads new timezone
- Stable table rows prevent UI jumping during writes

### Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- Frontend (Next.js 15) → API `/api/bacnet/write` → MQTT `bacnet/write/command`
- Worker MQTT callback → Queue → Async `execute_write_command()`
- Direct BACnet write via BACpypes3 `WritePropertyRequest`
- Write result published to `bacnet/write/result`

**Database:**
- No schema changes (existing Point table supports write operations)
- SystemSettings.timezone controls worker timestamp generation

**Performance:**
- Write command latency: <500ms typical
- Monitoring page: 50+ points updating every 30-60s
- No memory leaks or connection issues after extended testing

### Known Issues
- Worker must be manually restarted after timezone changes (docker compose restart bacnet-worker)
- Write history not yet stored in database (Phase 7 feature)
- Batch MQTT publishing still optional (disabled by default)

### Migration Notes
- No database migrations required
- No breaking API changes
- Existing deployments: Pull latest code and restart services
